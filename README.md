## Calculator
Calculator is a library for calculating a string into a double in Java, for example:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println(new Calculator().calculate("5+2/4"));
}
```
Output:
```
5.5
```

## Bugs
There are plenty of bugs and problems with this library, for example operations that is unary may not currently work.

## Upcoming updates
- Control what type operations can be used for each calculator instance
- Unary operators
- Postfix operators, like factorials
- Algebra
- Ability to save a variable into a calculator instance

## Usage
Anyone is welcome to fork and work on this project, I may accept pull requests only if they are reasonable.
